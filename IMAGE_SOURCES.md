## Tips for Finding Good Images

1. **Look for close-ups**: Images showing hands wearing gloves are often more effective than full-body shots
2. **Check the glove color**: 
   - Nitrile gloves are typically blue, purple, or black
   - Vinyl gloves are often clear or white
3. **Context matters**: Images showing gloves in use (medical procedure, food prep) are more compelling
4. **Quality check**: Ensure images are at least 1200px wide for the carousel
5. **Consistency**: Try to find images with similar lighting/color tones for a cohesive look

## How to Use Images

Once you find images:

1. **Download** the highest resolution available
2. **Optimize** for web (compress if needed, but maintain quality)
3. **Update** the `productImages` array in `/peliguard-website/app/page.tsx`
4. **Replace** the `src` URLs with your chosen images
5. **Update** alt text and captions to match the actual image content

## Notes

- Always verify licensing before using images commercially
- Most free sites don't require attribution, but it's good practice to credit photographers
- Consider purchasing images if you need very specific shots (e.g., Peliguard-branded gloves)
- You may want to hire a photographer for custom product shots showing actual Peliguard gloves
