# Peliguard Website Streamlining Plan

## Current Page Analysis

### 1. **Home Page** (`/`)
**Content:**
- Hero section with main value proposition
- Key Features (Made in USA, Quality Assured, Reliable Delivery, FDA Approved)
- Why Choose Us/Benefits (Transparent Supply Chain, Support American Jobs, First Line of Defense, Eliminate Market Uncertainty)
- How It Works (3-step process)
- Testimonials
- FAQ (6 questions)
- CTA section

**Strengths:** Comprehensive, covers all main selling points
**Weaknesses:** Very long page, some content overlap with other pages

---

### 2. **Our Story** (`/our-story`)
**Content:**
- Hero: "Why Choose Peliguard?"
- Our Story section (3 cards: Customers Are Neighbors, Quality Through Care, Made in Louisiana)
- Our Focus section (4 cards: Transparency, Reliability, Accountability, Made in USA)
- CTA section

**Overlap with Home:**
- "Why Choose Peliguard?" duplicates Home's "Why Choose Us?"
- "Our Focus" duplicates Home's "Key Features" and "Benefits"
- Same messaging about Made in USA, transparency, reliability, accountability

**Recommendation:** **MERGE INTO HOME** - This content should be integrated into the home page as an "About Us" or "Our Story" section, eliminating redundancy.

---

### 3. **Wholesale** (`/wholesale`)
**Content:**
- Hero: "Wholesale Inquiries"
- Why Partner section (4 features: Reliable Supply Chain, Quality Control, Made in USA, Transparent Service)
- Contact Information section (Email, Location, Visit Us)
- CTA section

**Overlap:**
- Contact information duplicates Contact page
- Features overlap with Home page content
- Essentially a specialized contact form

**Recommendation:** **MERGE INTO CONTACT** - Add a "Wholesale Inquiry" option to the contact form or create a dedicated section on the Contact page for wholesale inquiries.

---

### 4. **Contact** (`/contact`)
**Content:**
- Hero: "Contact Us"
- Contact form (Name, Email, Subject, Message)
- Contact Information card (Email, Location, Visit Us)

**Strengths:** Clean, focused contact page
**Recommendation:** **KEEP BUT ENHANCE** - Add wholesale inquiry section here

---

### 5. **Privacy Policy** (`/privacy-policy`)
**Content:**
- Legal privacy policy text
- Contact email for privacy concerns

**Recommendation:** **KEEP SEPARATE** - Legal pages should remain standalone

---

## Proposed Streamlined Structure

### **New Site Structure:**

1. **Home Page** (`/`) - **ENHANCED**
   - Hero section
   - Key Features
   - Why Choose Us/Benefits
   - **NEW: Our Story section** (merged from `/our-story`)
   - How It Works
   - Testimonials
   - FAQ
   - CTA

2. **Contact Page** (`/contact`) - **ENHANCED**
   - Hero section
   - **NEW: Inquiry Type selector** (General Inquiry / Wholesale Inquiry)
   - Contact form (adapts based on inquiry type)
   - **NEW: Wholesale Benefits section** (condensed from `/wholesale`)
   - Contact Information
   - CTA

3. **Privacy Policy** (`/privacy-policy`) - **UNCHANGED**
   - Keep as-is

---

## Content Consolidation Strategy

### Home Page Enhancements:
1. **Add "Our Story" section** after "Why Choose Us"
   - Merge the 3 story cards from `/our-story`
   - Keep it concise (2-3 cards instead of 4)
   - Focus on: Customers Are Neighbors, Quality Through Care, Made in Louisiana

2. **Remove redundant "Our Focus" section**
   - The transparency/reliability/accountability messaging is already covered in "Why Choose Us" and "Key Features"

3. **Keep existing sections** - they're well-structured

### Contact Page Enhancements:
1. **Add Inquiry Type selector**
   - Radio buttons or tabs: "General Inquiry" | "Wholesale Inquiry"
   - Form adapts based on selection

2. **Add Wholesale Benefits section** (when Wholesale selected)
   - Condensed version of wholesale benefits
   - 2-3 key points instead of 4
   - Focus on: Reliable Supply Chain, Quality Control, Made in USA

3. **Unified Contact Information**
   - Single source of truth for contact details
